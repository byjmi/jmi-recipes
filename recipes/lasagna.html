          In a large pot over medium heat, cook beef until brown. Drain off all
          fat. Add onion and cook until translucent. Add tomato paste, crushed
          tomatoes, water, oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir
          until combined and cook over medium heat until boiling. Reduce heat to
          low and simmer for 1 hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          While sauce is simmering, blend cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and
          egg until smooth. Set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and
          cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Spread 1 cup of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover
          sauce with 3 noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the remaining sauce.
          Top with 1/2 of the mozzarella. Place another layer of noodles and one
          of sauce over the mozzarella; top that with the cottage cheese
          mixture. Top with remaining 3 noodles and remaining sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella on
          top and bake 15 minutes more, until golden and bubbly.
